## Argumentation

### 2.1: Emerging trends plan

Decided to look into programming paradigms for the emerging trends. I created a plan to do some small research towards what defines a programming paradigm and what kind of programming paradigms are out there. Furthermore, I will create some small application in one or more paradigms in either c++ or paradigm specific languages.

### 2.2: Emerging trends PoC

Created proof of concepts for different paradigms in C++
- [Object-Oriented](https://github.com/SjorsScholten/ProgrammingParadigms/blob/master/apps/ObjectOriented.cpp)
- [Procedural](https://github.com/SjorsScholten/ProgrammingParadigms/blob/master/apps/Procedural.cpp)
- [Functional](https://github.com/SjorsScholten/ProgrammingParadigms/blob/master/apps/Functional.cpp)

### 2.3 Emerging trends research document

Did research towards programming paradigms.

### 2.4 Research Documentation S6

Every sprint there would be 2 domains to research which we did as a team. !e would use a 7-step approach to guide us through the process.
