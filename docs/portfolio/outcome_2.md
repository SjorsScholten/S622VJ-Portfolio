## Argumentation

### 2.1: Emerging trends plan

Decided to look into programming paradigms for the emerging trends. I created a plan to do some small research towards what defines a programming paradigm and what kind of programming paradigms are out there. Furthermore, I will create some small application in one or more paradigms in either c++ or paradigm specific languages. 

### 2.2: Emerging trends PoC

Created proof of concepts for different paradigms in C++
- Object-Oriented
