## Argumentation

### 3.1: Internship Orientation

In sprint 0 I started looking at possible internship locations. I thought about what I wanted to do as an internship and my current plan is to look for something in game development or C++. Im not going to rule out other more regular internships (for example software development in C#), as they could be useful if I don't find one with my needs.
