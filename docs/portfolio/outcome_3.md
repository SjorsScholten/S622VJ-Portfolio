## Argumentation

### 3.1: Internship Orientation

In sprint 0 I started looking at possible internship locations. I thought about what I wanted to do as an internship and my current plan is to look for something in game development or C++. Im not going to rule out other more regular internships (for example software development in C#), as they could be useful if I don't find one with my needs.

### 3.2 Emerging trends

Use emerging trends to discover new paradigms that are useful for my target domain.

### 3.3 Minor system programming in C++

Finished a minor systems programming in C++, where I was thought to program in C++. C++ is a common programming language in my target domain, due to being very fast. During my minor we learned how to create a game engine, this is a valuable addition to my portfolio.
