## Argumentation

### 8.1: Database Orientation

Made the choice to use MongoDB as a database for my system. From previous use I know that MongoDB is a scalable NoSQL database which can run in the cloud. Next step is to figure out how to implement it.

### 8.2 MonogDB Implementation

Set up a docker container running an image of MongoDB when starting the backend in local environment. The application can read and write to this database. The next step is to apply it to the development environment by connecting it to the cloud endpoint.
