## Argumentation

### 5.1: GitHub environment

Worked on setting up the organization for our team in GitHub. 

- Created the team and added everyone to that team.
- Set up branches for the team with branch protection.
- Added a template repository for setting up future services.
- Created a master repository.
    - All the repositories and documentation are now available in a central place.
    - Issues can be gathered in one place.
    - All services can be pulled with one recursive clone.
- Started on documentation on how the organization works and how to set up for future teams.

### 5.2 Local environment

Made it easier to run the local environment to a bat script. With executing a single script the developer can set up his local environment in docker.

### 5.4 GitHub actions CI/CD
