## Argumentation

### 1.1: Sprint 0

Started with getting to know the group and setting up channels. We created a WhatsApp group to keep in contact with each other. I reorganized the old teams channel for the current semester. We are going to use more of GitHub features to organize the project. In GitHub, we can create a backlog and agile boards to organize our sprints. In the old semester we used to have azure, but the old azure is not usable anymore.

### 1.2: Weekly PO meetings

Every Monday of the week we have a small update with the product owner.
