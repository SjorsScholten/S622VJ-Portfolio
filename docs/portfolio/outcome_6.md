## Argumentation

### 6.1: Cloud Service Orientation

In the first sprint I made the decision to use SonarCloud and MongoDB as cloud services in my system. SonarCloud will perform a static code analysis and is free to use for open source projects. MongoDB is a NoSQL database which you can use a free version of in the cloud, you can also run MongoDB as a docker container for local development. Next step is to implement both services.
