## Introduction

[How to read this portfolio]: #

### [GP] Group project

IPost is a package managing system created for Fontys. With this system the user can register and track packages across the delivery process within Fontys.

IPost is a microservice based system realized with ASP.NET Core for the backend and React for the frontend. Data is stored on MSSQL database with a database per service architecture.

### [IP] Individual project

Food-for-Thoughts is a social media platform where users can express their thoughts in small posts. Users can create an account, and use that to create posts and follow other users.

Food-for-thoughts is realized with ASP.NET Core for the backend and React for the frontend. Data will be stored using MongoDB, which will run in a cloud environment.

## Starting point

This is my second time doing this semester, also being the second time doing the GP.

## Retrospective

### Sprint 0

This sprint was oriented around the hack-it week and launching the projects. I started off early with documentation and planning, giving me a good start on my products.

### Sprint 1

In this sprint we started on setting up the environment for the IP and improving the current state of the GP code base.

For the GP I mostly worked on replacing the API-Gateway, which will now be done using ocelot. I researched the usability of the tool and created documentation on how to use the tool for future teams.

For the IP I created the initial architecture documentation and set up all the backend services and frontend. I took a decision on the tools and frameworks I wanted to learn this semester. 

Next sprint we will start on creating a foundation for 

### Sprint 2

In this sprint I started with developing the first few user stories in order to lay a foundation for the learning outcomes. This sprint I also became infected with corona, so there was not much happening in the first week, making this sprint only 2 weeks.

For the GP I worked on phasing out the old API-Gateway with the new Ocelot API.

For The IP I worked on improving the frontend and connected the backend to the database. I improved my local development environment by making it up and running with one command. I added a local MongoDB container to my environment and connected my backend services. For the frontend I created the first few pages and components in order to display the data and results for the requests. I created the first REST call towards the backend from the frontend.

Next sprint I will continue creating components for the frontend and start on implementing the authorization and authentication functionality. By the end of the next sprint the user should be able to log in.
