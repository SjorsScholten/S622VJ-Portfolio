IPost is a package managing system created for Fontys. With this system the user can register and track packages across the delivery process within Fontys.

IPost is a microservice based system realized with ASP.NET Core for the backend and React for the frontend. Data is stored on MSSQL database with a database per service architecture.

### [IP] Individual project
